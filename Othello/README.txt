Extras: 

In the scoreboard, the first number represents the number of games the player has won and the second number
represents the number of peices the player has on the board.

The valid-move indicators (the green portals) represent the valid options for the next move. 

The pieces on the board and the banner resize according to the window size (doesn't work too well when the window is too small).

The two computer buttons at the bottom-right corner can be pressed to allow an algorithm to play for the current player.
Both buttons use the same implementation of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficiency.
The "hard" button runs the algorithm with deeper search depth than the normal button.  


Note that a tie can be created (by coincidence) by repeatedly clicking on the normal computer button.
